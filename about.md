The Student Language Exchange, a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization founded by students at Brown University, was a pioneer in diversifying language learning and global engagement in American universities. By harnessing an underutilized resource on college campuses— the knowledge, experience and social reach of international students— to run semester-long programs introducing their peers to their language and culture, the organization sought to fill gaps in curricula and prepare students to build collaborative solutions to the world’s most pressing social, economic, political and environmental challenges.

In 2019, the organization ceased central operations and open sourced their resources, including this language learning activities database, in the hopes that these resources might be valuable for other like-minded initiatives. The database is maintained by Amelia Friedman, who can be contacted via Twitter @ameliafriedman.
