# student-language-activities
This repository is a recreation of the Student Learning Activities Wordpress site.

Each blog post on the site is a markdown file with a layout type (in this case, post), title, date created, author, categories, tags, a permalink, and the post's content. Only the post's title is used on this site at the time, but in future iterations of this site all of the values are available for use.

This site was created by [Tishana Trainor](https://github.com/tishana) using Jekyll and is hosted using GitHub Pages. You can read more about Jekyll [here](https://jekyllrb.com/).
Pagination and Categories/Tags pages were assited by a posts by Sharath at [Web Jeda](https://blog.webjeda.com/tags/#Jekyll).
