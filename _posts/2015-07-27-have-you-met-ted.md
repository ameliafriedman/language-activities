A role-playing activity for groups of at least three. Everyone is given a card with a brief description of their character (e.g. name, job, hobbies, personality, physical appearance, etc) and one person is assigned as matchmaker. The matchmaker begins by asking the first person about their character in the target language. The matchmaker then uses this information to introduce and talk up the first person to a second person (e.g., “Have you met Ted? He’s a great architect and loves long walks on the beach”).  Afterwards, the first person becomes the matchmaker and tries to introduce the second person to someone else.
