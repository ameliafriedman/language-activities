Bananagrams, Go Fish, Scrabble, Twister, Clue, Life, Trivial Pursuit, Scattergories, Cranium — many board games can be adapted to fit into your classroom. You may need to write different clues or change a few rules, but if you’re creative, there is incredible potential to build something really cool! And, if you have board games from the target culture, even better!
