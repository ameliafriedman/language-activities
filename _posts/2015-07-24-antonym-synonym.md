This game is suitable for students with a fairly large vocabulary. Have each student write a word on the top of a clean sheet of paper, then pass it to the right. The next student writes an antonym for that word, then passes it to the right. The next student writes a synonym, then passes it to the right. The next student writes a word that starts with the same letter, then passes it to the right. You can use a lot of different prompts to elicit a wordbank of vocabulary, then review those words to make sure everyone remembers the meanings. It is often funny to look at where you end up (kind of like the game “Telephone” if you’re familiar).
