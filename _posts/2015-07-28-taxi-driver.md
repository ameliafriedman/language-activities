Show a map of your hometown complete with landmarks (either from your experience growing up, or typical tourist attractions). Ask a student what they want to see. Once they tell you, point to where you are “currently” on the map, and tell them you’re a taxi driver and need directions to get to the next place. As they navigate, point to where you are on the map. If they tell you to go in the wrong direction, just do it. They’ll realize their mistake! Once you get to the location, tell them about it and share any important cultural features. Then move on to the next student and have them pick another landmark.
