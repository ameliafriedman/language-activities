Have the class break into partners. Each partner will tell the story of their name (could be just their first name, or their entire name!) to one another. Give the group about 5 minutes. Once each has told their story, each will tell the story of their partner’s name to the class. This game will help the class remember one another’s names, while beginning to show the cultures of each classmate. It also begins to show the importance of the meanings behind words such as names!
