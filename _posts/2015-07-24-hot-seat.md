This is an idea for after students have learned how to ask and answer different questions. You, the fellow, are in the “hot seat” at the front of the class, and the students get to ask you any questions they want. Or rather, they can ask you any questions they know how to ask properly. If you tell them about this activity ahead of time, they may pay more attention to question structure and vocabulary.
