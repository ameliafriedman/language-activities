Have your own Olympic games! Many cultures have sports that take up traditional pasttimes or have a prevalence in society. Divide the class into teams, and then have them play culturall relevant games. They don’t have to all be sports (e.g. you could include an origami contest or a search for the afikomen or anything else semi-competitive). To make it more challenging, allow the teams to only communicate with one another in the target language— if they speak English, they lose points! Before each activity, teach them words associated with action, such as pass, stop, go, and words of encouragement so they can rally their teammates!
