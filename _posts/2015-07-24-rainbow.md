Hand out a list of objects, each associated with a different color and at least two objects for each color. For instance, if I was talking about American color associations, I might provide the words for taxi cab (yellow), stop sign (red), etc. Put a sticky note with the name of the color on the forehead of each student, and have them line themselves up in the order of the rainbow without peeking at what color they have been assigned. They have to find out what color they are by asking each other if it is the color of a stop sign, for instance.
