Each student (or group of students if you have a shy class) practices a song you give them a few times, then sings it karaoke style for the class. This helps them practice pronunciation and flow. For extra fun, have each student in the room give them an adjective about their performance, give them a numerical rating (in good fun), or otherwise comment (depending on vocabulary youâ€™ve already used). This activity is better suited for more outgoing groups.
