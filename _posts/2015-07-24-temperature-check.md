Every class, introduce a new way to answer the question “How are you?” and a few new ways to respond. Then go around the room allowing everyone to answer how they are using responses they have learned at any point in the course. This allows you to add new content, review old content, and get a sense of how everyone is feeling before jumping into your first activity.
