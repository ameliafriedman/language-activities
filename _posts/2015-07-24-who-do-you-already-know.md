Ask students to write down (or shout out) as many words as they know in your language, or English words that come from your language. If they have lots, ask them to share! If nobody can think of any, have a list of words prepared that are commonly used in English and are derived from your language. You can also do a similar activity with cognates. If you know of any interesting stories of how your language seeped into English or vice versa, tell them!
