Turn your classroom into a gala (or whatever your cultural equivalent might be). Teach students a common dance, and encourage students to engage in whatever activities would typically occur in that space (small talk, dancing, drink a traditional [non-alcoholic] drink, spending time with their “date,” etc.— whatever feels right!). You may also choose to bring in objects from home to spice up the event (e.g. food, books, clothing, decor, etc.)
