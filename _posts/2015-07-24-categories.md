Have students stand in a circle. Pick a category (e.g. cities where your language is spoken, family member vocabulary, objects that belong in a classroom, etc.). Students go around in a circle saying things that fit into the established category. The first student who cannot come up with something needs to step out of the circle. Last person standing wins. This is a great way to review vocabulary. After each round, quickly go over the vocabulary or cultural content that was brought up to make sure everyone understands.
