Think of a bunch of different phrases down that are commonly said to specific people. For example, “My dog ate my homework” would be said to a teacher, “I would like to order a martini and spaghetti” would be said to a waiter/waitress, “Fetch!” would be said to your dog, etc. To have your students practice listening skills, read them in front of the class and have them guess who each one would be said to. Or, students can read the phrases out loud to the other students to proactice reading skills. This might be especially helpful after you’ve talked about professions or family members; they can review that vocabulary. If, for example, the phrase is “You’re in big trouble!” one possible response might be “mother.”
