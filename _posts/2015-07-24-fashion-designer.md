If you want to practice clothing and color vocabulary, this is a fun way to do it! Have a student describe their “latest design,” and have another student draw what they hear. It is extra fun if you can locate enough colored dry erase markers to do this in front of the entire class. If not, you might consider beraking students into pairs so that they can draw on pieces of paper, then tape up all of their masterpieces for a fashion gallery. You can also use this as an opportunity to bring in traditional dress, and perhaps have that inspire their own creations!
