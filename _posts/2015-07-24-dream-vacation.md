Have your students plan a three-day vacation to a region speaking your language. Have them search for a place to stay (perhaps through Airbnb), plan their itinerary, figure out an transportation within the region (although probably not the flights into the region), and anything else. Could be a group or individual activity. This may be done in the target language (a challenging language review activity) or in English (a more cultural activity).
