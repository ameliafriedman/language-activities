Center a section of your lesson, or all of your lesson, on a cultural artifact â€“ a very famous painting, a poem, or a particular dance. Start by asking students to guess what it is, then give them some information. Do a very close reading of what it says about your culture. If it is a poem, for example, go word by word. Eventually open out to a wider context and explain how this is relevant to your culture as a whole. If it is a particular dance, for example, talk more widely about dance. If it is a painting, talk about an art movement.
