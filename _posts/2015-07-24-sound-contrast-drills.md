There are often sounds in a language that are difficult for non-native speakers to differentiate between. To help students grasp these differences, consider working with minimal pairs. This means that you would add a consonant (if working with a vowel) so that you can repeat the sounds in fast sequence. For example, you might say Co Cö Cu Cü to practice similar vowel sounds.
