Have students change their Facebook language settings for a day to the language they’re learning. Given that they’re probably already used to the terminology in English and know what settings should say, see if they are already familiar with the vocabulary. If so, it’s a good check, if not it’s a great way to learn more vocabulary in a different context. Check in the next week to ask how its going, and to see how many students are still using Facebook in the target language. Encourage them to try doing the same for their email client, other social media sites, or any other computer application they use.
