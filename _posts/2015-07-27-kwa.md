This is a fast paced game to practice directional words and other vocabulary. Everyone stands in a circle. One person starts the game by pointing to the person on their left, right, or across from them and while saying the name of the direction in the target language. Whoever is pointed at has to point to a new person as fast as possible while saying the correct direction. If someone makes a mistake, theyâ€™re out until the end of the round.
