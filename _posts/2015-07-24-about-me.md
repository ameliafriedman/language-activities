Students write on a piece of paper several things about themselves in sentences. (can be anything youâ€™ve been working on: favorite color/movie/TV show, what class year they are, etc.) Then mix up the pieces of paper and randomly pass them out. Students have to go around the room to find whose paper they received by asking questions of the other students.
