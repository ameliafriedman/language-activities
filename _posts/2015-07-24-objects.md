After you have covered some basic object vocabulary, ask everyone to write 3 that they can see in the room on post-it notes. Then put them all in a hat and everyone picks three out. They then have to find the object and put the post-it note on it. You can also do this with descriptors, which can get pretty hilarious if people start putting post-its on one another.
