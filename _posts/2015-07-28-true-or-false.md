Say a sentence that is definitely true or false. Students have to think about the meaning of the sentence and guess if it’s true or false. This can work well with pictures: display a picture and say something about it that’s true or false. It can also be an interesting Day 1 activity that allows you to diffuse stereotypes and have frank conversations about your culture.
