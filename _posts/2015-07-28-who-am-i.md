Write names of famous people (perhaps people you have discussed in the course) on pieces of paper. Without looking at what it says, each student tapes one of the papers to their forehead. Then everyone walks around and asks each other questions about the person on their forehead to try to figure out who it is. (e.g. Am I male of female? What is my job?)
