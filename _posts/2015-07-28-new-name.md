You might consider giving each student in your class a new name. Through giving each student a class name, you can talk about the cultural significance of names in your culture. It is also a good way to build a community in your classroom. You may also consider giving them a transliteration sheet and having them try to write the name in your language, which you can then correct. You can take this a step further by asking them to create a name card and to bring it back each week.
