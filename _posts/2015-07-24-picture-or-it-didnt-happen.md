Have students show some pictures of their favorite activities. They can bring them in ahead of time or you can ask them to email them to you ahead of time so you can make a powerpoint. Thisis a great way to introduce new vocabulary for activities and hobbies because you can use an immersive method— you shouldn’t have to switch to English. Then, after introducing the words, you can use new pictures (or pictures from other students) to review and ask students to “tell me what’s happening in this picture.”
