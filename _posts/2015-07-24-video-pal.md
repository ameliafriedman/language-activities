Hold a video conference between your class and a friend attending university back home. Lead a conversation about the similarities and differences of being a college student there and in the US. Before meeting, you should ask students to prepare questions (and you should prepare some that they might not think of but will prompt good conversation). Depending on level, you can have this conversation in English or the target language. Regardless, you should ask students to try to write the question in the target language, even if they won’t understand the response unless it’s in English. Be sure to test the technology well ahead of time.
