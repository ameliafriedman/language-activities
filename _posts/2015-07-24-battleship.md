Have students break into pairs. Bring in a game of battleship or create one to print on sheets of paper. (If your language uses a non-Latin alphabet, change each letter to a letter from your language.) Teach students the phrases they need in order to play, or equip them with a phrase sheet. By playing the game, they practice numbers and letters.
