A great way to address stereotypes and introduce unfamiliar aspects of your culture is through “Two Truths and a Lie.” To do this, think of two true things about your culture and one lie. Then, ask the class to guess which is the lie. You probably want to do this in English, but you may choose to repeat yourself in the target language so they can hear it. This gives you an opportunity to engage the classroom and then dispel any misconceptions. Consider doing 5-10 rounds on one of the first days so that you can introduce many different aspects of your culture.
