Have each student take out a sheet of paper and write a sentence at the top of the page. For example, if you’re learning simple present tense, someone might write “I like to eat bananas.” Then, have all students pass their paper to the right. The next student will have 60 seconds to draw a picture representing that sentence. Then, they will fold the paper so that only the picture is visible, and pass the paper to the right. The next student will have 60 seconds to write a sentence of what’s shown in the picture, then fold so only the sentence is visible. This continues until everyone gets back their original paper. The students can then unfold the papers and see how well the sentences matched the pictures (or not, as the case may be!).
