Have each person grab a sheet of paper and fold it based on how many people are in the group. So if itâ€™s a 6 person group, fold it five times (thereby creating six sections). Each person has 60 seconds to write the beginning of a story with a picture depicting their sentence, and then passes the paper to the next person. Continue until you reach the end of the page, and then read the whole thing for amusement.
