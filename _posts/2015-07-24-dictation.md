Dictation forces students to really listen and learn to discriminate the many new sounds of the target language.  Read something slowly as your students write down your words.  It is better that these be phrases and sentences that they might not totally understand, forcing them to try to determine spelling patterns and pauses for punctuation.  A list of your languages idioms and proverbs can be useful here.
