Tell your students to come up with one item. They can either be told ahead of time, or they can find something in their backpack/around the room. Then, distribute fake money (perhaps printed money from the target culture) and conduct an auction! Each student will describe and “sell” their item to the highest bidder. You may start by setting an example. This is a great way for students to practice numbers and descriptors.
