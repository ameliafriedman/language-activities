For this activity, you will need to ask students to bring laptops or reserve a computer lab. It can be done individually or in pairs. Depending on their level and the complexity of your questions, you can have them conduct their searches in English or the target language. For each round, think of a question or category, e.g. find me a Bulgarian seaside town that has more than 100,000 inhabitants?! Find me a festival that happens in Bangladesh in the month of June? Find me the word in Siswati that means the English equivalent of ‘sorry’? The first student to get the correct answer gets a point.
