This is a good way to introduce the cuisine or eating habits of the target culture after learning some basic food vocabulary. Show a picture of a particular dish or meal to the group and ask them to compile a shopping list (in the target language) of ingredients they would need to make the dish. To take this further, have a few participants role play buying the ingredients at a store or market and engage in some bartering. You can also share the steps to prepare the dish or the meal, and encourage students to try to cook traditional meals for the next session.
