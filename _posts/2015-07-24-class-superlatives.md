Have students break into two groups. Each group will decide on superlatives for all members of the other group and prepare short speeches about them and their contribution to the course. These can be as silly or sincere as they choose. You might consider bringing in “plaques” (e.g. paper plates) for students to write the name & award on (perhaps with some decorations). Once all awards have been decided, students will each come up to the front of the room to give a speech about another student and award them their superlative. You can act as the host & call each person to the “stage” to announce the awards.
