Everybody stands in a circle. You say something, and people who it applies to would step in, and those who it doesn’t would stay where they are. For example, you might say: “Step in if you have green eyes.” You would continue with other characteristics, like “Step in if you have a brother”. The people who have already stepped in stay in if the next fact applies to them, and if it doesn’t, they step out. Keep going with more facts. If students are able to, they can lead the activity.
