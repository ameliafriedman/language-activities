Before class, prepare a scavenger hunt for your students with each clue leading to a place where the next clue can be found. If the clues are in the target language, students can practice reading sentences. You can also turn this into a cultural activity by writing culturally-relevant clues. If you donâ€™t want to have people running around campus, you could create your landscape on the board, project it onto a whitescreen, or print handouts.
