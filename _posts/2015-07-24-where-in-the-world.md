Make a list of traditions (or show short videos/slides in a powerpoint) that have passed on from your country to elsewhere. For example, you could use Irish dancing, which is now practiced in the northeast of the US and elsewhere. Ask the participants to guess where else they might find these traditions, and then explain why theyâ€™re practiced elsewhere and how they arrived in the region. This may be a good entry point to discussing the diaspora, and how emigration has impacted other parts of the world.
