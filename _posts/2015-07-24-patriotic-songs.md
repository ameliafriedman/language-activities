Who wrote your countryâ€™s anthem? When? What are the sentiments it expresses and how much or how little are those sentiments still important to people? Play a recording of your anthem or other patriotic songs in class, teach any key phrases in the lyrics, and discuss the questions above. Print out the lyrics so that you can sing together, which is a great activity to help pronunciation and to help develop natural speech patterns.
