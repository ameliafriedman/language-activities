Give each student a slip, one has the beginning of a sentence, one has the end. The students have to find the student with the other half of their sentence. This is particularly good with dates, or to reaffirm conjugations. For example: “In 1963… Kenya became independent” or (to reinforce linguistic concepts) “My brother… grew into a man.” Depending on their fluency or your goals for the lesson, the statements can be written in the target language or in English. You can run several rounds of this, or you can use it as a way to match students for a partner activity.
