In this activity you can use an actual newspaper if you have one or an online source. Pull up a major newspaper from the United States that you have previously chosen, or one that the class suggests. Pick a section, such as the front page or sports, and have the class read over the headlines. Discuss what’s going on! Then pull up a newspaper from the target country/language/culture. Compare the format of the papers to start— What are the pictures like in the different papers? What are the names of the reporters? Then have the class try to read the headlines— are there any words they recognize? Can they guess the topic from the pictures? Read the headlines for them. Have a discussion about what is going on in different parts of the world. Focus on the differences between what is talked about locally versus globally— are there similar stories in both papers?
