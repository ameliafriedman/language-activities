Have students identify one word that means something concrete and different under each tone. Then, make a flashcard with a picture of the each concrete item, with the character or the spelling on the other side. Every time you pronounce a different tone, have students show the picture it corresponds to, emphasizing that they each tone means different things. Once they get better at it, silently show students picture and ask them to recite the word.
