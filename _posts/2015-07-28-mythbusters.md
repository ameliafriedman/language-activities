Hand out 5-10 sheets of paper to each student. Have them write something (probably in English) about your culture on each piece of paper. Tell them that stereotypes are welcome! This is anonymous! Then, go through each submission and tell students whether it is fact or fiction. Elaborate as necessary! (This may also be fodder for a great blog post.)
