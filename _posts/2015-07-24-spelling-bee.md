This activity will follow the format of traditional spelling bees. Have students line up next to the board. Say a word out loud (in the target language) and have the first student in line spell it on the board. If they spell it correctly, have them get back in line. If the spell it incorrectly, they are “out” and they must sit down. Keep going until there is only one student left.
