This is a great activity for after students have learned how to ask and answer different questions (have the line move down one person each time). Divide the students into two groups and have each form a line. Give each student in line A a question they have to ask. They can be as simple or complicated as you want. (e.g. Where do you live? What is your favorite animal?) Students in line B take turns with each person in line A to answer their questions. Then switch, and have students in line B ask the questions.
