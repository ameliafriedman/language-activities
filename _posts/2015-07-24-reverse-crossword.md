Create a crossword puzzle together. Students take turns coming up to the board and adding blanks for words. Discuss the definitions in the target language together. You can also make thematic crosswords that help review or introduce new tidbits of the target culture. Record and you can use it as a review tool later! Visit our helpful websites section for a crossword puzzle generator that you can use to make crossword worksheets once your class has created one.
