Have the class as a group write the vocab words on a set of index cards. On a separate set of index cards, have the class as a group write out the definitions. Collect all the cards and mix them up. Each student is given one vocab word and one definition— make sure they don’t already match! The first student asks, “Who has…(reads definition)?” The student who has the match replies, “I have… (reads word).” Play until all the matches are made. You can divide the class into teams to earn points to make the game more competitive!
