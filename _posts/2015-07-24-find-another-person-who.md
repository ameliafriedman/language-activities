Give the students a list of traits, for example: someone who is American, someone who is not American, someone who has 3 sisters, someone who has been to Russia etc. (although written in your language, of course). The students must speak to each other and tick off all the traits on their list. Or, you can format this information into a Bingo card, and the first person who gets five in a row wins.
