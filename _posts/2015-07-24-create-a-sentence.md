Make four piles, and for each rip up several pieces of paper to write the following: 1) “When?” write several times (e.g. yesterday, today, now), 2) “Who?” write several people (e.g. you, me, us, Britney Spears), 3) “Where?” write several places (e.g. class, concert, restaurant), and 4) “What?” write several verbs you have already studied. Each student picks one slip of paper from each pile and tries to construct a sentence. Depending on what you’re studying, you can have different types of piles or include different vocabulary.
