Make a small stack of cards with interesting (possibly controversial) topics written on them such as love, jealousy, alcohol, drugs, corporal punishment, family, etc. Have them pick a card and talk about the topic as much as they possibly can in the target language. Ask follow up questions to generate a more lively discussion.
