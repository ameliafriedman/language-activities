This is a good activity for after you have practiced common dialogues. Prepare slips of paper in pairs. Each pair should have one line of a two-line conversation (e.g. How are you / I’m doing well; I need to go home / I’ll see you later then.) Randomly pass out the pieces of paper to your students. They have to go around the room, trying to find their match.
