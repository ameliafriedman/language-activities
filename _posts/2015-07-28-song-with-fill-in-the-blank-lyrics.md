Choose a fairly simple song in your language. Create worksheets with the lyrics, taking out some of the words and replacing them with _________s. Play the song for students (several times) as they try to listen carefully to fill in the missing words. If you’re working on conjugation, for example, you may replace all of the verbs with blanks. Or, if you’re working on sentence structure, you might leave out a few words for students to become especially aware of word order. This can also be used to help pronunciation if you ask students to sing together after you’ve filled in the blanks. You can also talk about the significance of the song, show a music video, or share a translation to turn it into a cultural conversation.
