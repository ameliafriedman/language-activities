Share stories (either made up or real) of people from your culture. Include their names, a little bit of backstory, their hobbies, their favorite foods, etc. Then, each person in the class chooses (with your help) their own name in the target language, and then writes their own backstory. They can pretend to be this person for the rest of the class, or maybe even the rest of the semester!
