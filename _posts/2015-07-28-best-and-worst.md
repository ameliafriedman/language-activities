Have class go round and mention the best and worst aspects of the culture that they identify with, and possibly give explanation as to why they feel so about those aspects. This would be in order to further explore connections, relationships, personalities, conflict of interest, etc. that influence those preferences. Then you, as facilitator, can find connections to your culture to help them better understand where you come from.
