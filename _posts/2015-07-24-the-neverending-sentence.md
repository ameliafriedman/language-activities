This is best explained with an example: You start with a short sentence (e.g. “I drink juice”) then slowly add to it (“I drink juice from a glass,” “I drink juice from a glass at my house,” “I drink too much juice from a glass at my house,” “I always drink too much juice from a glass at my house”). You probably don’t want to get that complicated, but simple drills like this when learning sentence structures (using several different examples) might help elucidate where different pieces belong in a sentence. After students get the hang of it, you might consider going in a circle and having each student add to the sentence. This can be a written or spoken activity.
