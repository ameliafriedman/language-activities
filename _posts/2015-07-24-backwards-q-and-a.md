Write some facts or names or places on the board. Have students try to guess the questions that correspond with the tidbits of info on the board. After they have constructed questions for each of them, have them try to build their own sets of questions and answers based in earlier conversations about your culture. If you want to get really fancy, you can have the groups try to challenge each other to think of the question that corresponds with their new sets of questions and answers.
