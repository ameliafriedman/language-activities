Write 5 vocabulary words on the board and place one student under each word; these students are the “bottles.” Have the students still in their seats “spin the bottles” by calling out definitions. When one of the players standing at the board hears his/her definition, he/she will spin around once to indicate this, then you can change the word. If the student fails to spin when their definition is called, they must return to their seat and a student currently seated takes their place.
