In the first class jump straight into introducing yourself in the target language. Say “Hi, my name is ___, what is your name? Pleasure to meet you.” Students will be shocked to begin with, but they’ll quickly pick it up! Don’t switch to English— just keep trying to get them speaking in your language by repeating after you until they can introduce themselves and ask/answer “how are you?”
