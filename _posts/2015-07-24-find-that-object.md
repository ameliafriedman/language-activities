This activity requires students to know direction words (under, next to, far away from, etc). One person hides an object while everyone else closes their eyes. Then the person gives clues to the others so they can find the object. You can also spice things up by bringing in realia for students to find. That way, each time the object is found, you can discuss a new cultural object!
