Have the class break into teams and write a 10-page children’s book. Each page has one sentence and a quick drawing. Then, they do a dramatic storybook reading in front of the class. Story circle!! This is a nice end-of-course activity that gives students the opportunity to show off what they’ve learned. If you can, give some feedback on sentences before they write them on the final product!
