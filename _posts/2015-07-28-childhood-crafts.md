Bring in materials to do a favorite childhood craft that is embedded in your cultural consciousness. For instance, if I were teaching about America I might choose Thanksgiving “hand turkeys”, string friendship bracelets, or paper fortune tellers. Introduce new vocabulary to talk about the materials, a holiday it is associated with, or aspects of childhood. This is a great way to introduce a new cultural unit, or to celebrate a holiday or historical event together. Depending on time, you may have the class get crafting together!
