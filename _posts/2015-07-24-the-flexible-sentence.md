When learning conjugations or declentions, it may be helpful for students to see how this form differs from familiar forms. You may be learning how to conjugate the verb “to be,” so you start with the familiar sentence: “I am hungry” then write “I was hungry” and “I will be hungry,” etc. Then write up the present tense form of another simple sentence and have students come up to the board to write the additional versions themselves.
