This is always a fun game, and it can help your students practice their reading skills if you display the questions on the board, in the target language. You could include fill-in-the-blank sentences as questions. Another idea is to include a culture category. You can adapt pretty much anything to the game. You can find templates for Jeopardy by searching the web for “jeopardy powerpoint template.”
