Students sit in a circle. The first person says something about him/herself. (e.g. I am a freshman.) The second person then repeats what the first person said and adds something about his/herself. (e.g. Lisa is a freshman. I like the color green.) Continue around the circle until everyone has had a turn. This helps students practice sentence structure because they have to change the subject of the sentence.
