This is an activity that can really help you narrow in on the intonational characteristics of particular words and phrases.  Longer words and phrases can be particularly difficult to master because our brains are still working through the first part of the utterance when the last part is already finished. So, for example, you might be working on saying “miraculous,” so you’ll say “lous, repeat” then “culous, repeat” then “raculous, repeat” then “miraculous, repeat.” Success!! This can also be done for tough phrases. Building backwards though help to break the phrase up and somehow improves the ability to work through the whole phrase. This method probably won’t be used in isolation, but instead when a particularly challenging word comes up during the course.
