If your language has a writing system that looks different in print than in handwriting (e.g. compare your handwriting to Times New Roman), give everyone an opportunity to try handwriting the letters with guidance. Otherwise, they may have trouble understanding how to produce the letters they see on handouts. Provide a handout of the alphabet in print with the handwritten letters beside them, and include space to practice the letters. Go through on the board and demonstrate one letter at a time how to hand write the lettersâ€” demonstrating is important because there is usually an efficient standard order and direction of strokes for making each letter. Be sure to remind the class what sound each letter makes when you write it, and encourage them to repeat the sound as they write to have a better chance of remembering it. They can practice by figuring out the spelling and then writing their name (first and last!) on their own.
