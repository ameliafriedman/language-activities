Write the target vocabulary words on the board, spacing them out all over. Divide the class into teams of 4 or 5, and give each team a fly swatter. Mark a starting line on the floor about 5 feet from the board, and make each team stand in a line behind it. With one team member going at a time from each team, the facilitator calls out a definition, and the first player to swat the correct answer gets a point!
