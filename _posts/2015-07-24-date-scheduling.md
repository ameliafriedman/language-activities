Give each student a different schedule with times that they are unavailable clearly marked off. Then tell them that they have to schedule an hour long meeting with every student in the room. Then, have them wander around the room and communicate with other students to try to schedule their dates. This is an excellent way to practice asking and answering questions, numbers, telling time, and days of the week.
